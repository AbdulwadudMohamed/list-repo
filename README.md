<h1 align="center">Bash Script To List Github Repos</h1>

## Introduction


The goal of this project is to list GitHub repositories of the User which is defined in script. To use the GitHub API to get a list of the repositories. I am trying to make a standard listing script that I can build and improve. Decided to expand on this project to develop a script that can be called with python. Afterwards displaing the data with some form of data representation.
