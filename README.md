<h1 align="center">Automated Analysis of GitHub Repositories using Bash and Python</h1>

## Overview


This project's goal is to automate the listing and analysis of the GitHub repositories of a specified user. The project uses the GitHub API to gather information about the repositories and display the data visually. Integrating bash and python code in this project was to demonstrate my limited but growing ability in these scripting environments and my ability to resolve issues. The project developed used a combination of bash scripts and python code (matplotlib and subprocess). At the end of this project, the aim is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for analysing the activity of a GitHub user's repositories.
